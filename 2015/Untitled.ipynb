Please see our coding exercise below, let me know if you have any questions and I can connect you with someone from the team!Looking forward to hearing from you soon!\\n\\n\\nWe are looking for a program that manages disjointed intervals of integers. E.g.: [[1, 3], [4, 6]] is a valid object gives two intervals. [[1, 3], [3, 6]] is not a valid object because it is not disjoint. [[1, 6]] is the intended result.\\n\\nEmpty array [] means no interval, it is the default/start state.\\n\\nWe want you to implement two functions:\\n\\nadd(from, to)\\nremove(from, to)\\n\\nHere is an example sequence:\\n\\nStart: []\\nCall: add(1, 5) => [[1, 5]]\\nCall: remove(2, 3) => [[1, 2], [3, 5]]\\nCall: add(6, 8) => [[1, 2], [3, 5], [6, 8]]\\nCall: remove(4, 7) => [[1, 2], [3, 4], [7, 8]]\\nCall: add(2, 7) => [[1, 8]]\\n\\netc.\\n======\\n\\nThis is not a very simple problem, please take your time and try to get the code bug free if you can. There is no time requirement, and you can use any programming language. \\n\\nTo give you some context of a practical application for such a solution, you may imagine it being used to define mechanic’s availability for a day. A key responsibility of the Engineering team here at Your Mechanic is ensuring timely matching of mechanic availability to customer demand for a service and the mechanic’s calendar is an integral part of that process.\\n\\nAs an example, these intervals could be thought of as representing ranges of time within a day, in terms of the number of minutes from midnight.  E.g: the interval array: [[0, 62], [150, 180]] would represent the ranges of 12:00 AM to 1:02 AM and 2:30 AM to 3:00 AM. The add/remove functions can be thought of as adding or removing available time from the day’s schedule.  E.g: remove(420, 480) implies that the entire period from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM is now unavailable on the schedule.\\n\\nWhile the mechanic calendar is one application of the algorithm, it may not be the only one. Please consider the above illustration only as one example among many.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any additional questions and I can connect you with someone from the team!\\n'"
